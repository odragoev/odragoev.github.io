        <p>
        I will be working in the <a href="https://edithlaw.ca">Augmented Intelligence Lab</a> at the University of Waterloo to help design a collaborative machine teaching platform that enables
        multiple annotators to reflect on their labeling patterns and identify bias.
        </a></p>
       <p>I've recently finished a Software Developer - ML Platform internship with <a href="https://www.odaia.ai/">Odaia Intelligence</a>,
        an innovative startup in the life sciences space, which leverages an AI-driven solution to
        help pharamaceutical companies connect with physicians more efficiently - reducing patients' time to therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
        There, I designed software architecture that automates the creation of reports depicting the predictive performance of internal algorithms,
        maximizing customer confidence and providing value for prospective deals.
        I also trained and evaluated a new ML model - which would significantly reduce data preprocessing and unify several models into one,
        simplifying the overall design of the ML Ops pipeline.
        </a></p>
       <p>
        Previously, I have completed a Software Engineering internship at <a href="https://www.cisco.com">Cisco Systems</a> contributing to 
        the creation of a new infrastructure concerning network-related tests, as well as developing in-house utilities.
        I have also previously interned as a Web Application Developer at the University of Waterloo's <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/">Computer Science Computing Facility</a>,
        and was involved in building web applications concerning course and exam management for students.
